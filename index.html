        <h1 class="about">About Us</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">The oldest restaurants are likely the small stalls and vendors like you still see at any major town.
             The Edicts of Ashoka in ~250 B.C. specifically require rest-houses for travelers, and it's likely they and other taverns/inns would provide food for them and locals. 
             Even today, many of the best restaurants are attached to hotels.
